# W.I.P

The original repository for this project was created by my ex-classmate during our collaboration for the DeepDive in September.
Since he owns it, I don't have the privileges to change its visibility settings for the project itself nor a fork.

Please check out the original!

# To Do

1. Changing variable + page names since they're quite lacking
2. Cleaning up the JS
3. Redesign
